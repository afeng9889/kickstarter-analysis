# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
- Louise is planning a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for up and coming play. 
- By organizing and sorting crowdfunding data from previous successful and failed projects, we can help Louise determine if her goal is reachable.

### Purpose
Using data given to analyze and determine if there are specific factors to a successful or failed campaign. By comparing locations, donations received, and categoiries, and sorting it into a readable format, we can easily determine key elements in each data point.
Performing analysis on this data will help us uncover trends. 

## Analysis and Challenges
There are a number of data points from multiple countries and different categories of projects. We will need to sort throught the relevant criterias to extract correct information to help determine what led to a successful or failed project.
There were multiple countries in the data set, and we needed to determine if every country should be used.
There were over 4000 rows of data and we had to filter by the relevant data, such as US, categorizing the data into theater and plays.
We had to separate the initial category into parent and subcategory by using Delimiter in the Data tab. This would allow use to choose more specific subcategories for our analysis.
After sorting, we had to take a look to see if the reason why a certain project failed was because the goal amount was too high or if it was because of the premise of the play, etc.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We can draw data from the chart showing a larger number of successful campaigns when the launch date was in May and June. We can also see there were no cnaceled campaigns in October. However, we cannot determine the reason.
We can also see that there were more projects launched in the middle of the year (May to August).

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
From an initial look, we can see that there were no projects canceled. Majority of the projects' goal was under $5000. We can see there may be a correlation between a higher goal amount to a higher failure amount. However, the amount of projects with a higher goal than $40,000 were low.
More than half of the projects have goals above $5,000 and only half succeeded in their goals.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There were a lot of rows to sort through. It is difficult to find correlations in the data to help Louise determine the best course of action for her crowdfunding campaign.There may not be enough data to conclude if higher goals will indeed lead to a failed project.
Depending on Louise's goal, she may need to find further evidence in her specific "Goal" block. If her goal falls within the $25,000 range, she may need to find more data in this specific range before she should proceed.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1) Based on the line chart, we can clearly see a spike of successful outcomes for theaters when the project was launched between May and June throughout the years. 
2) There were no failed theater projects prior to 2014.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1) There were more projects with less than $5,000 than all other goals combined.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Though we have a lot of usable data, we cannot fully conclude why some plays received more backing than others. 
We are unable to sort plays based on the premise/blurb. The pledges could be stemmed from an individual's subjective tastes.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We can create additional charts that shows the average donation  per backer for each month/year.
We can also sort number of successful/failed/canceled projects based on countries.
